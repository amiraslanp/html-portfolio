<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hi everyone. This is me, Parvin, typing a code for you :) </p>

<p>I am very excited to share my first website with you. 
  In fact, I work now in a completely different field than web development. </p>

  <p>A month ago, I decided to change the sphere and got acquainted with web development. 
  I realized that this is exactly the area that interests me. I am still at the beginning of this path.  
  I hope to share more professional websites with you soon. Wish me luck :) </p>
  
  <p>And don't forget that it's never too late for anything. 
    The key is to keep going. </p>
    
  <p>Have a good day.</p>
